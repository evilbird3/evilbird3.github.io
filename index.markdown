# Enter the Lamb's Head
## The Adventures of Ranthos &bull; Book One
*Released January 1, 2021*

Ranthos and his sister Bellelar must fend for themselves after their berserker clan abandons them far from home. The locals hate and fear his peopleâ€™s magical blood and bestial senses, and he knows violence is inevitable.

When offered a bargain to escape their rotten life, Ranthos accepts, believing it the only chance to protect his sister.

But freedom can only be won with the death of a wicked creature, rumored to be immortal. A beast with grotesque magic that has butchered far stronger men than him.

Outcast and abandoned by the world, Ranthos must risk everything to save his sister. But the task seems impossible and will require him to embrace the legacy of his blood, a legacy that might cost him his life.
